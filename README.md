## Repository Structure

    ├── Configuration Parsers/
    ├── device-drivers/

    ├── OpenAPIs/
    ├── Studio Projects/

```

The `Product/` level only appears for vendors with more than one product (e.g., `AWS/EC2/`, `Cisco/IOS/`). Single-product vendors are flattened, with asset folders directly under the vendor (e.g., `Kentik/OpenAPIs/`).

Each product folder includes a `README.md` with import instructions, dependencies, and configuration details.
